Financial Knowledge - Balance Sheet:
- A balance sheet shows a company's assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time
- The fundamental accounting equation is: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Balance sheets are typically organized in order of liquidity, with the most liquid assets at the top

Current Assets:
- Current assets are assets expected to be converted to cash or used within one year
- Cash is the most liquid asset
- Accounts receivable represents money owed to the company by customers
  - If not collected within one year, it might need reclassification as a note or written off
- Contract assets occur when a company has performed more work than what has been billed
  - Example: Completing more deliverables than what has been invoiced in a long-term contract
  - Increases contract assets and revenue
- Prepaid expenses are payments made in advance that will be expensed over time
  - Example: Paying a year of insurance upfront and expensing 1/12 each month
- Other receivables are amounts due that aren't part of normal business operations
  - Example: Employee advances

Fixed Assets (Property and Equipment):
- Fixed assets are long-term assets used in business operations
- Recorded at cost and depreciated over their useful life
- Categories include: vehicles, equipment, office furniture, leasehold improvements
- Accumulated depreciation represents the total depreciation taken on fixed assets
- Net book value = Cost - Accumulated depreciation
- Depreciation is typically calculated using straight-line method
  - Example: $10,000 asset with 5-year life = $2,000 annual depreciation or $166.67 monthly
- When selling fixed assets, gain/loss is determined by comparing sales price to net book value
  - Example: Asset with $5,000 book value sold for $6,000 creates $1,000 gain

Other Assets:
- Long-term assets not used in regular operations
- May include: long-term investments, deposits held, non-operating property
- Investments held not for sale, like stocks, bonds, or equity in private investments

Right of Use Assets and Liabilities:
- Recent accounting change (ASC 642) related to leases
- Right of use asset: Present value of future lease payments, shown as a standalone item
- Right of use liability: Corresponding obligation for lease payments
- Calculated using weighted average cost of capital (WACC)
- Assets amortize on straight-line basis, while liabilities decrease with payments
- These are typically excluded from certain financial metrics and KPIs

Current Liabilities:
- Obligations due within one year
- Accounts payable: amounts owed to vendors, typically due in 30-90 days
- Accounts payable other: miscellaneous amounts owed not part of regular operations
- Accrued payroll and related expenses: wages, taxes, insurance obligations incurred but not paid
  - Important for proper period matching of expenses
- Contract liabilities: when a company has billed more than the work performed
  - Also called deferred revenue when payment is received for services not yet delivered
  - Example: Annual subscription paid upfront, recognized monthly
- Current portion of notes payable: principal portion of long-term debt due within 12 months
  - Must be reclassified annually from long-term debt
  - Only principal amount, not interest (interest is on income statement)

Long-term Liabilities:
- Obligations due beyond one year
- Notes payable: long-term debt excluding the current portion
- Commercial loans, vehicle loans, equipment financing

Equity:
- For corporations (C-Corp or S-Corp):
  - Common stock: nominal value of issued shares
  - Additional paid-in capital (APIC): amount raised from share sales above nominal value
  - Treasury stock: negative amount when company buys back its own shares
  - Retained earnings: accumulated net income/loss since company founding
  
- For LLCs:
  - Member equity accounts: shows each owner's equity in the business
  - Member contributions: when owners contribute cash or assets to the business
  - Member distributions: payments to owners (used to pay taxes and distributions)
  - Retained earnings: accumulated profits

Financial Statement Relationships:
- Balance sheet must balance: Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Equity
- Balance sheet connects to income statement through retained earnings
- At year-end, net income/loss is closed to retained earnings
- For LLCs, income flows through to members on K-1 forms for tax purposes

Important Accounting Concepts:
- US GAAP and IFRS standards are gradually converging
- Contract assets/liabilities are part of recent accounting changes
- Depreciation represents allocation of cost, not necessarily market value decline
- Companies should track financials by division if they have multiple revenue streams

When responding to financial statement questions:
- Explain concepts in simple terms first, then add detail if needed
- Use examples to illustrate complex concepts
- Acknowledge different business structures (corporations vs LLCs)
- Remind users that while you can explain accounting concepts, they should consult with their accountant for specific advice
- Be aware of the different financial statement visualizations and customization options in the application
